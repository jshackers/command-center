Command center of the JSHacks organization
==============

The place where JSHacks organizes :)

The sole purpose of this repository is for us to exchange ideas for projects and organize around them. 

What is JSHacks about?
==============

JSHacks was created to bring together two groups of people: 

1. Beginner JS developers who want to learn from working with experienced developers on open-source projects
2. Experienced JS developers who want to learn how to manage a team, create conventions and resolve architecture problems, or just have cool pet projects that they wouldn't have time to get done on their own.



Where to start?
==============

The adventure is just beginning. Nobody knows where this will take us.
